We want a simple web page that tracks a deck's matchups against other decks.

Druid
Hunter
Mage
Paladin
Priest
Rogue
Shaman
Warlock
Warrior


Qualities of a player deck
	has a name
	has overall matchups against the nine heroes
		each hero matchup is further broken down into aggro/midrange/control

class Deck:
	string name
	Map<string,Matchup> Matchups

class Matchup:
	string classname
	int aggroGames
	int aggroWins
	int midrangeGames
	int midrangeWins
	int controlGames
	int controlWins

Save files:
	a savefile consists of a sequence of strings delimited by the character '|'
	a field 'player' indicates the next string will begin a new player data set
	a field 'deck' indicates the next several strings correspond to matchups for a new deck

ex:
player|Andromeda|deck|Warlock|Handlock|Druid|0|0|0|0|0|0|Hunter|0|0|0|0|0|0|Mage|0|0|0|0|0|0|Paladin|0|0|0|0|0|0|Priest|0|0|0|0|0|0|Rogue|0|0|0|0|0|0|Shaman|0|0|0|0|0|0|Warlock|0|0|0|0|0|0|Warrior|0|0|0|0|0|0|

the save file should be easily parsed. 
	player flag indicates a new player object should be populated with name equal to the next field
	deck flag indicates a new deck object should be populated with the following class, name, and matchups
		note that the six counters associated to each matchup are preceded by the matchup's class name
		the order of the matchup counter fields are as follows
			games played against aggro
			games won against aggro
			games played against midrange
			games won against midrange
			games played against control
			games won against control

so a save file should look like this:
	player|player name|[deck|deck class|deck name|[matchup|aggro games|aggro wins|midrange games|midrange wins|control games|control wins]...]...

where the deck fiel
